# Entreaties
The database creator for this site can be found at https://github.com/HobbyHobbyist/EntreatiesDatabase

This is the frontend and API of the Entreaties project. Running it locally is very straightfoward.

Have MYSQL, MYSQL Connector, and a MYSQL user, then input that user's info into this project's database creator's initial db connection, run the database creator. Step 1: Create database is finished.

Activate the environment and pip install the requirements.txt file in the entreaties folder, then run (assuming windows) "(python | python3 | venv/scripts/python) EntreatiesRequestHandler.py". Step 2: Create and start API is finished.

Change directory to entreaties/frontend. (NPM | Yarn) (install | add) the package.json, then run "(NPM | Yarn) Start". Step 3: Create and start frontend is finished and you can ideally view the site with full functionality now.
